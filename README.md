# Portal Mapping And Modding's Offical Discord Bot: The Watcher

The [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot used in the Portal Mapping And Modding Discord server named The Watcher.

***This bot is still a work in progress! Some bugs and other issues are expected to happen!***

- The `main` branch contains the code set the bot runs on the Discord server.
- The `stable` branch is a backup branch that contains the last stable code set for the bot. Used if `main` breaks.
- The `dev` branch is the bot's development and testing branch. Any new changes go through here before going into `main`.
